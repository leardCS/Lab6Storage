# Lab6Storage

To calculate my current and highest possible grade in my CISC 3130 course, I coded a simple grade calculator that asks me to input my grades for different categories of the course such as: practice problem grades, lab grades, and midterm grades to then recieve a current numeric grade as well as a letter grade. 

Taking into account the current grades, the calculator will then calculate the highest possible numeric & letter grade if I were to recieve full points on future unsubmitted assignments such as practice problem assignments #7 & #8 (12 total points), lab #6 & #7 (4 total points), and the final exam (20 total points).

Example execute with my current grades of the CISC 3130 grade calculator:

Enter the # of Practice Problem assignments you have submitted: 6

Practice Problems #1 Grade: 4

Practice Problems #2 Grade: 6

Practice Problems #3 Grade: 6

Practice Problems #4 Grade: 6

Practice Problems #5 Grade: 6

Practice Problems #6 Grade: 6

Enter the # of Labs you have submitted so far: 5

Lab #1 Grade: 1

Lab #2 Grade: 2

Lab #3 Grade: 2

Lab #4 Grade: 2

Lab #5 Grade: 0

Enter your grades for midterm #1 and midterm #2

Midterm #1: 7.5

Midterm #2: 3

Current numeric Grade: 84

Current letter Grade: B

Highest possible numeric grade given current scores: 87

Highest possible letter grade given current scores: B
